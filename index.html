<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>1. <a href="https://apprendeneolatino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Educational Website</a></h3>
<p>An educational website built using the documentation platform Docusaurus. This project is ongoing and consists mostly of original content written by myself. I work with an international group of linguists and community members to develop the best product possible.</p>

<h3>2. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zE_s3mBoGgl8VEzWVkFRz7eocrH0Aq9S/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SampleTech Policy</a></h3>
<p>This document is a generic version of a document my team and I worked on with a real company. As <strong>Team Leader</strong>, I helped my fellow team members stay on task while understanding their individual circumstances. I wrote detailed Meeting Minutes for every meeting. I both wrote original content and implemented content with extensive input from employees from the company.</p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tc3C6NfNjC8UcSyUJPVawDAjp42pDOu_/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Trek Style Guide</a></h3>
<p>This document is a style guide set in the Star Trek Universe for members of Starfleet Command. This document was a collaborative effort between the entire class where I worked as a <strong>Technical Editor</strong> and <strong>Chapter Editor</strong>.</p>

<p>As <strong>Technical Editor</strong>, I worked with General Editors and the class as a whole to assemble everyoneâ€™s work into a cohesive document; this included attending regular meetings, writing instructions for classmates, and applying technical skills (page linking, headers/footers, cover page, table of contents, etc.). As <strong>Chapter Editor</strong>, I also wrote original content for my own chapter in my individual group.</p>

<p>This document was a challenge in part because material in the Star Trek Universe does not extensively address mundane topics. Therefore, I had to extrapolate from a combination of Star Trek media and real-world sources to write the content of my chapter.</p>

<h3>4. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n24NYABi0mwRQBJgZWsYTJgdtJad3CP5/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moodle Instructions For Students</a></h3>
<p>This document is a set of instructions for the Course Management System (CMS): Moodle. I led two teams: one team from the US (my primary team) and the other in France. This project consisted of two phases: Phase 1 (creation of the original document) and Phase 2 (translation into French).</p>
<p>The US team studied Moodle and created the attached document under the idea that we had to write for an international audience and translation.</p>
